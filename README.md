# My Portfolio Website

This website is my first HTML project, using CSS to theme the webpage.

This project's kanban board can be found [here](https://github.com/users/Jacob-KW/projects/1).

## How to access

The website is available [here](https://jacob-kw.github.io/jacobkw.github.io/).

### Template

This is an adaptation of the [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/) template [Hyperspace](https://html5up.net/hyperspace).

In Summer 2024 I plan to migrate this website to a standalone, so that I can begin to create dynamic webpages.
